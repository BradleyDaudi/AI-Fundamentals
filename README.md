> *"It's me, an AI Engineer in the making!"* 👾

Welcome to the repository documenting my quest through the **30-Day AI Fundamentals Course** at **Zindua School**. This isn't just a course; it's a warp pipe into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, agents, vibe coding and modern tooling.

Below is a chronicle of the skills I've collected, the bosses (complex concepts) I've defeated, and the cool projects I've built along the way.

## 🎮 World 1: The Engine Room (Models & Settings)

Before jumping on the track, you need to understand your kart. In the AI world, this means understanding the models and how to tune them. I learned that choosing a model isn't random; it requires strategic analysis of **Pricing** (can we afford the coin drain?), **Performance Benchmarks** (speed vs. intelligence), **Context Length** (memory capacity), **Latency** (time to first token), and **Multimodality** (support for images/audio).

Once the character (model) is selected, we have to tweak the settings in the "Options Menu" for optimal performance. I dived deep into **LLM Settings**, learning to adjust **Temperature** for creativity versus precision, using **Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)** to control the vocabulary pool, setting **Max Tokens** to limit output length, and defining the **System Prompt** to give the AI its specific role before the game even starts.

## ⭐ World 2: The Golden Star (Prompt Engineering)

This is the core mechanic of the game. As the instructors at Zindua emphasized: **"Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO)."** To get a high-score response, you can't just button-mash. A perfect prompt requires a specific structure containing four critical elements:
1.  **Role:** Who is the AI talking to?
2.  **Context:** What are we building?
3.  **Action:** What specific thing needs to happen now?
4.  **The Vibe/Constraints:** How should the output look and behave?

### 🚫 The "Game Over" Pitfalls
Even experienced players fall into traps. I learned to identify common mistakes that ruin a prompt, such as being **Too Vague** (insufficient context), having an **Overloaded Ask** (trying to do too much in one turn), drowning the AI in **Overloaded Context** (unrelated topics), forgetting the **Audience**, or failing to define **Constraints**.
